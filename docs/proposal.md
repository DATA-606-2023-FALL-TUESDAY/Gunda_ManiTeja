## Background
### Problem Statement

This project aims to predict individualâ€™s smoking and drinking habits using their health metrics. The dataset is provided by the 
National Health Insurance Service in Korea and contains a wide range of health indicators, including height, weight, waistline, 
blood pressure readings, cholesterol levels, and liver enzyme readings. By analyzing this data, we aim to determine the impact 
of smoking/drinking on these health metrics of the individual.


### Potential Real-world applications

**Health Risk Assessment:**  By analyzing the correlation between health metrics and smoking/drinking habits, healthcare professionals can 
develop more precise risk assessment tools. These tools can predict the likelihood of certain health complications based on an individual's 
habits and physiological measurements. 

**Public Health Campaigns:** Governments and health organizations can utilize the findings to design personalized health interventions and 
public health campaigns. For instance, those who smoke and show specific detrimental health metrics can receive targeted advice and resources 
to quit smoking. 

**Insurance Premium Calculation:** Insurance companies can use this data to adjust health insurance premiums based on the risk associated with 
smoking and drinking habits. Those who smoke or drink might face higher premiums, incentivizing healthier lifestyle choices.

**Health tracking wearables:** Companies developing wearable health technologies, like smartwatches that monitor various health metrics, 
can integrate these models trained from these datasets to provide users with real-time feedback on the potential health impacts of their habits.


### Research Questions
- Is smoking and drinking really independent of each other? Do all drinkers smoke or Do all smokers drink?
- Is it true that the majority of drinkers/smokers are men? What percent of smokers or drinkers are women?
- What age groups do the majority of smokers/drinkers belong to?
- What are some key health indicators (features) that correlate with smoking and/or drinking habits?
- How do different machine learning techniques (linear vs. non-linear) compare in the identification of smoking & drinking habits based on their health parameters and which models can most accurately classify individuals?
- As per the best performing models, which features are most important for identifying smoking status or drinking status?

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Calculate summary statistics for all numerical features, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles.
- Check for missing values, duplicates and handle them.
- Identify and handle outliers that may impact the accuracy of classification models.
- Explore correlations between health parameters, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and hemoglobin, to identify potential associations.
- Investigate how health parameters vary with age and gender, as these factors can influence health outcomes.
- Determine the importance of each feature in classifying smokers and drinkers using appropriate feature selection techniques (During the modeling phase).


## Model Training 

- As data size is moderately large, I plan to use google colab/kaggle to train the models.
- Python packages to be used: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
- Train/Test data: Split the data to create train (70%) & test (30%) splits.
- Feature Creation/transformation: Write code to transform categorical features into numerical features.
- Modeling: start with basic models like KNN, logistic regression, decision tree and move to more complex ones such as random forest and gradient boosting.
- Metrics & Evaluation:  As this is a classification task, Accuracy scores, f1-score and confusion matrices will be used for performance measurement.
